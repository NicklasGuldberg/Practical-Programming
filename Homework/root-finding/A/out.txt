As a test we solve the simple system f(x,y) = [x^2 - 2y, y^2 - 3x] 
The guess is      x0  =          2          3 
The solution is [x,y] =       2.29       2.62 
Inserting it back into the function gives us f(x,y) = [0.00186082447501956, 0.00203383366907328] 

Now we find the extremum of f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y - x^2)^2
The gradient is gradf(x,y) = (2x + 400x^3 - 400xy -2,  200(y-x^2)) 
The guess is      x0  =         5          5 
The solution is [x,y] =         1          1
