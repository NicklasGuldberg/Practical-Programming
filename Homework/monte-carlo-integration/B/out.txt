Halton quasi-random sequence Monte Carlo integration with N=1000 of f(x,y,z) = x + y + z from [0,0,0] to [1,1,1]
= 1.49566810599566, with error approximately 0.00656738175868776
Analytical result should be 3/2

Plain Monte Carlo integration with N=1000 of f(x,y,z) = x + y + z from [0,0,0] to [1,1,1]
= 1.50237551640923, with error approximately 0.0162778672563465
Analytical result should be 3/2

We note that the error of the quasi-random is significantly less than the plain integrator
